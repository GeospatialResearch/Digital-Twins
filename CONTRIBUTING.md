# How to contribute to our Digital Twin

## Bug Reporting
If you find a bug, please [fill out a github issue](https://github.com/GeospatialResearch/Digital-Twins) for it and label it as a bug.
We will triage it and evaluate a fix.

Please provide as much detail as you can about what caused the bug, if you can replicate it, and details on what you think the expected behaviour should be.

If you can identify any part of the code it's related to that would also be helpful but not necessary.


## Contributions
Please contact us if you would like to contribute to a new feature. For bug fixes we appreciate Pull Requests.


## Feature requests
Feature requests are appreciated. We are currently working towards deliverables that will likely take priority over requests but they can serve as inspiration.
Please feel free to open a discussion item or issue for a request.
