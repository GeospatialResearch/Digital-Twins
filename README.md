## Introduction

According to the National Emergency Management Agency, flooding is the greatest hazard in New Zealand, in terms of frequency, losses and civil defence emergencies. 
With major flood events occurring on average every 8 months [(New Zealand â€“ FloodList)](https://floodlist.com/tag/new-zealand),
it is necessary to produce high precision flood models and in order to do better planning, risk assessment and response to flood events.

The Flood Resilience Digital Twin can provide a better understanding of the degree of impact flood events can have on physical assets like buildings, roads, railways, transmission lines, etc.
The digital twin not only represents the current status of the visualised assets but also how they will perform/react to future situations. 
The digital twin, when used to run flood models combined with other sources of information can allow us to make predictions.

Data for analysis and modelling are collected from open data portals provided by multiple organisations or data providers such as LINZ, StatsNZ, opentopography, NIWA, MFE, and more.

See our [draft paper for Journal of Open Source Software](paper/paper.pdf) for more details.

## Basic running instructions
The following list defines the basic steps required to set up and run the digital twin.


### Requirements
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


### Required Credentials:
Create API keys for each of these services. You may need to create an account and log in
* [Stats NZ API Key](https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/my/api/)
* [LINZ API Key](https://data.linz.govt.nz/my/api/)
* [MFE API Key](https://data.mfe.govt.nz/my/api/)
* [NIWA Application API Key](https://developer.niwa.co.nz/) - Create an app that has the Tide API enabled.
* [Cesium Ion Access Token](https://ion.cesium.com/tokens)


### Starting the Digital Twin application (localhost)
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

1. Create a file called `api_keys.env`, copy the contents of `api_keys.env.template` and fill in the blank values with API credentials from the above links.
   
1. Create a file called `.env` in the project root, copy the contents of `.env.template` and fill in all blank fields unless a comment says you can leave it blank.
Blank fields to fill in include things like the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` variable and `CESIUM_ACCESS_TOKEN`. You may configure other variables as needed.
    
1. From project root, run the command `docker compose up -d` to run the database, backend web servers, and helper services.
   
1. You may inspect the logs of the backend using `docker compose logs -f backend celery_worker`


## Using the Digital Twin application
1. With the docker compose  application running, the default web address is <http://localhost:8080> to view the web application.
1. Choose input variables from the available input boxes at the top of the page.
1. Select an area using Shift+click+drag to draw a bounding box of your area to start generating a model. It will take a long time, especially for the first run of an area.
1. Monitor progress by checking the logs using `docker compose logs -f celery_worker`.
1. The API is available by default on <http://localhost:5000>. Visit <http://localhost:5000/swagger> for API documentation.
