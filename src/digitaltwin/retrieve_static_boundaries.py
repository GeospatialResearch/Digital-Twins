    Connects to various data providers to fetch geospatial data for the selected polygon, i.e., the catchment area.
    Subsequently, it populates the 'geospatial_layers' table in the database and stores user log information for

    Parameters
    ----------
    selected_polygon_gdf : gpd.GeoDataFrame
        A GeoDataFrame representing the selected polygon, i.e., the catchment area.
    log_level : LogLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG
        The log level to set for the root logger. Defaults to LogLevel.DEBUG.
        The available logging levels and their corresponding numeric values are:
        - LogLevel.CRITICAL (50)
        - LogLevel.ERROR (40)
        - LogLevel.WARNING (30)
        - LogLevel.INFO (20)
        - LogLevel.DEBUG (10)
        - LogLevel.NOTSET (0)

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function does not return any value.
